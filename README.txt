CRUD + Authentication Example

Frontend Technology: Angular.js
Backend Technology: Laravel

01/09/2017 Update:
1. Watched few videos to merge power of Angular.js and Laravel
2. Made a simple Bootstrap template for dashboard, crud operation forms to insert data from user
3. Did a small routing using angularjs to navigate among available hyperlinks
4. Made a simple bootstrap form accept the data from user
5. Get the user inputted data in Angularjs controller
6. Stored that data in MySQL database by sending that data to POST Laravel REST API 
7. Was able to complete the create functionality by combining Angular.js and Laravel

04/09/2017 Befor Lunch Update:
1. Had created the User Input functionality using Laravel Routing
2. Then searched the web to route using AngularJS
3. Again changed the frontend routing using AngularJS in HTML pages rather than blade.php pages
4. Created master layout in blade.php and then using ngView created other pages in html
5. Used Laravel REST API to fetch all the existing data of users from database
6. Displayed this data in HTML page to successfully complete Show All Users Functionality
7. In order to iterate the JSON data coming from REST API used the angular functionality of ng-Repeat to display all the data
8. Now will work on Edit and Delete functionality and will then move on Authentication using REST API
